* Challenges I encountered was what to make a function.
* We overcame this challenge by looking back at our notes
* A key takeaway I have is how functions can make a code so much faster and more organized. Before I would have to type this code out
* five times but now thanks to function I can just call the function instead.
* I learned what I was supposed to because I had practice with making functions and nesting functions in each other.
* Working with Catlin went well, we both communciated in and outside of class about the lab.
* The goal fo this program was to create a program that could figure out the total cost of 5 rooms based on their area and floor type
