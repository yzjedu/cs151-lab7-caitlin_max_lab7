### Comments on the grading
- Completely a wrong way of using functions. 
- You should have seen the solution that is provided in Lab 6. 
- It doesn't work for floating point numbers. Mobile app. 
### Grade: R

### Participation Grade: S
N for catlin
 - If participation grade is unsatisfactory check the `NO` in the documents sections
